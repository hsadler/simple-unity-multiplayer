Ideas for Unity Multiplayer Game Server library:
    - API:
        - synch data from game-client to game-server
        - synch data from game-server to game-client
    - functionality:
        - game state is a single object
        - game state updates are entirely client authoritative
        - all game state client->server synchs result in a broadcast of the 
            updated game state
        - all clients have equal authority to update game state (any deviation 
            from this policy must be implemented on the game-client, such as a 
            "game owner" client which would have the ability to run environment 
            entities, for instance)
    - walk-through:
        - client connects with server
        - server synchs inital game state to client
        - player makes input
        - input causes game state mutation
        - game state is synched to server
        - server broadcasts new game state to all connected clients
